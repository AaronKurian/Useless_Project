### Project Description

The project is just a rover that can be controlled by WIFI anywhere. It uses ESP32's wifi capabilities to communicate with the user.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Developing an efficient and reliable remote-controlled rover that can be operated from any location presents challenges in ensuring stable communication and real-time responsiveness.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

This project leverages the ESP32‚Äôs Wi-Fi capabilities to create a rover that can be controlled via a wireless network, providing users with seamless remote access. The primary objective is to establish a robust communication link between the rover and the user, addressing potential issues such as connectivity drops, latency, and user interface usability to ensure smooth and responsive control over long distances.
